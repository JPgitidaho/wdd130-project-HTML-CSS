  <h1>Block vs Inline alignment</h1>
  <p>Earlier in the semester you were introduced to the concept of
              <kbd>block</kbd> and <kbd>inline</kbd> elements. Blocks flow
              vertically down the page by default, and inline flows horizontally across.
              You were also shown how to center both inline and block elements.
              Let's review that again now. Follow the activity instructions to make this poem flow down the page.</p>

    <h2>The Cataract of Lodore</h2>
    <p>...The cataract strong</p>
    <p> Then plunges along,</p>
    <p>Striking and raging</p>

    <p>Around and around With endless rebound:</p>
